        "From the above, we can see that our current model is correct 85.9% of the time when predicting a non-death, and 76.7% of the time when prediciting a death. Additionally, it is important to note that only 68.75% of all deaths were predicted as being deaths, while 90.1% of all non-deaths were predicted as non-deaths. Considering this is a medical application, it is far more important for the death predictions to have a high percentile, even if it sacrifices the non-death prediction percentile. This is because it is better to predict that somebody will die and be wrong than to predict that they will be ok and then have them die. So, lets try to adjust our probability threshold to get a result more favorable for our situation:"

However, it is important to note that now 80.2% of all deaths were predicted as being deaths, while 84.2% of all non-deaths were predicted as non-deaths. That is little more in-line with what we are looking for. It is a nice middle of the road option that gives a good prediction rate for both non-death and death, while giving a slight lean making sure the false negative rate is as low as possible without significantly sacrificing the other rates as desired. However, let's try a version that really leans into the idea that its better to have a false positive than a false negative:"
